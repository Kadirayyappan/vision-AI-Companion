# Vision AI Companion üëÅÔ∏èüñãÔ∏èüîä

## Overview
Vision AI Companion is an advanced Streamlit-based application that provides visually impaired individuals with access to image descriptions, text extraction, and text-to-speech functionalities. It leverages the power of Google Generative AI and Tesseract OCR for scene understanding and text recognition. The application is also integrated with a Text-to-Speech engine to convert the extracted text into spoken words.

## Features
- **Describe Scene**: Get AI insights about the image, including objects and suggestions.
- **Extract Text**: Extract visible text using OCR from the uploaded image.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Hear the extracted text aloud using a text-to-speech engine.
